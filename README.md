In this repository I am providing a ***one page structure*** with ***fixed top***, ***tooltips*** and ***parallax***.
To do the parallax effect I used a library available at the following website: https://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ and jQuery, except for everything else I learned in a *DevMedia* course.
